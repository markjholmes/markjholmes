- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @markjholmes !
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™ve just finished my PhD at the University of Namur, studying ecosystem stability and (kind of) plankton communities. Now I'm working at BC3 in Spain looking at the recovery of plants and herbivorous bugs in terrestrial metacommunities.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R, Julia, Obsidian, and a bunch of things that don't need to be on github.
